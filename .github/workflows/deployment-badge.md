# Deployment Status Badge

Add this badge to your main README.md to show the deployment status:

```markdown
[![Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

[![Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/TokuEng/customer-help-center/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TokuEng/customer-help-center/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
```

- ‚úÖ Green when deployment is successful

- ‚ùå Red when deployment fails
