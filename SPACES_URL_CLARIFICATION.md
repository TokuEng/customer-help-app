# DigitalOcean Spaces URLs Clarification

## Two Types of URLs

1. **Direct Spaces URL**: `https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com`
   - Direct access to your Spaces bucket
   - No caching

2. **CDN URL**: `https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com`
   - Same bucket but served through CDN
   - Faster loading due to global caching
   - Note the `.cdn` in the URL

## Current Configuration

Your `.env` file currently has:
```
SPACES_CDN_ENDPOINT=https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com
```

This is actually the direct URL, not the CDN URL. To use CDN, it should be:
```
SPACES_CDN_ENDPOINT=https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com
```

## Do You Need to Reingest or Redeploy?

**NO** - You don't need to reingest or redeploy yet. Here's why:

1. The database already has the correct Spaces URLs
2. The issue is that the bucket is still private (403 Forbidden)

## Steps to Fix (in order):

### 1. First, fix the bucket permissions in DigitalOcean:
   - Go to [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces)
   - Click on `customer-help-app-notion-images`
   - Go to **Settings** tab
   - Find **File Listing** and change from "Private" to **"Public"**
   - Click **Save**

### 2. Verify it's working:
   Test this URL in your browser (should show an image):
   ```
   https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/notion-images/2590b95a-751d-8051-9182-eb3aceab82be/2590b95a-751d-8021-8d08-d6f87ed326dd_67d35313.png
   ```

### 3. (Optional) Enable CDN for faster loading:
   - In the same Settings page
   - Find **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
   - Toggle it **ON**
   - Save

### 4. (Optional) Update your configuration to use CDN:
   If you enabled CDN, update `apps/api/.env`:
   ```
   SPACES_CDN_ENDPOINT=https://customer-help-app-notion-images.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com
   ```
   Then redeploy your app.

## Important Notes:
- The bucket MUST be set to "Public" for images to work
- CDN is optional but recommended for better performance
- You only need to redeploy if you change the CDN endpoint
