The issue: Notion provides temporary image URLs that expire after ~1 hour.
When articles are ingested, these URLs are saved, but they're invalid by the time users view them.

Solutions:

1. **Quick Fix - Hide broken images (Immediate)**
   - Update ArticleContent.tsx to hide broken images
   - Add fallback text or icon
   
2. **Better Fix - Proxy images through your API**
   - Create an endpoint that fetches images from Notion on-demand
   - Cache them for a period
   
3. **Best Fix - Store images permanently**
   - Download images during ingestion
   - Upload to DigitalOcean Spaces or similar
   - Replace URLs in content

4. **Alternative - Use Notion's public sharing**
   - Make the Notion pages public
   - Use the public URLs which don't expire
