# Slack Message: Customer Help Center Image Storage Update 🎉

---

Hey team! 👋

**TL;DR:** Fixed the broken images issue in our Customer Help Center. All images are now permanently stored in DigitalOcean Spaces and loading correctly in production.

## What Happened 🔍

Our help center articles had images that were breaking after ~1 hour because:
- Notion provides temporary image URLs that expire
- These expired URLs were causing broken images for customers

## The Solution ✅

We implemented permanent image storage using DigitalOcean Spaces:
- **During content ingestion**: Images are automatically downloaded from Notion
- **Stored permanently**: In our DigitalOcean Spaces bucket
- **Served via CDN**: Fast loading globally

## Technical Details 🛠️

```
- Storage: DigitalOcean Spaces (S3-compatible)
- Bucket: customer-help-app-notion-images
- CDN: Enabled for global performance
- Articles affected: 35 articles with images
- Total images migrated: 196 images
```

## Current Status ✨

- ✅ All images migrated and accessible
- ✅ No more expiring Notion URLs
- ✅ Production site showing images correctly
- ✅ Zero broken images

## For Developers 👨‍💻

If you need to re-run ingestion:
```bash
DO_DATABASE_URL='[db-url]' python scripts/run-ingestion-do.py
```

The system now automatically:
1. Detects Notion-hosted images
2. Downloads and stores them in Spaces
3. Updates articles with permanent URLs

## Impact 📊

Customers can now reliably access all help center content with images, improving the self-service experience and reducing support tickets about "broken images."

Let me know if you have any questions! 🚀
