# Slack Message: New "Submit a Request" Feature 🚀

---

**📢 New Feature Alert: Submit a Request Button in Help Center!**

Hey team! We've just launched a new feature that makes it easier for users to submit work requests directly from our Customer Help Center.

**What's New?** 
- 🔘 A floating "Submit a request" button now appears on every help center page
- 📝 Users can submit requests without leaving the help center
- 🎯 Built-in priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- 📊 Admin dashboard to track and manage all submissions

**How It Works:**
1. Users click the "Submit a request" button (bottom-right corner)
2. Fill out a simple form with their request details
3. Submit directly to our database
4. Admins can view/manage requests at `/admin/work-submissions`

**Request Types Supported:**
- 🐛 Bug Reports
- ✨ Feature Requests  
- 📚 Documentation Updates
- ❓ General Support
- 🔧 Technical Issues

**Why This Matters:**
- Reduces friction for users needing help beyond documentation
- Centralizes all work requests in one place
- Provides visibility into user needs and pain points
- Helps prioritize what to work on next

**For the Team:**
- Check the admin dashboard regularly: `[your-domain]/admin/work-submissions`
- Requests are tagged with priority levels
- Filter by status: pending, in_progress, completed

This should significantly improve our ability to capture and respond to user feedback! 🎉
